The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need for more robust disease surveillance infrastructure. However, the development of such infrastructure runs into a double-bind. It is difficult to understand and mitigate privacy concerns without actually-deployed systems. Likewise it is difficult to build realistic systems without access to data. To get around this problem, we created synthetic data that reflects a realistic disease outbreak. This data was used as a component in the US-UK Prize Challenge on Privacy-Enhancing Technologies


This dataset consists of 4 components:

    A synthetic population, representing a demographically realistic population
    Synthetic activities for each individual within the synthetic population, denoting where and when they left the house
    A contact network derived from these activities
    A set of disease states, the result of simulating the effects of a COVID-like disease within this population

There are two datasets available. One is a representation of the state of Virginia (~7.7 million individuals) and one is a representation of the United Kingdom (~62 million individuals). 
This data was synthesized. We combined multiple sources of publicly available data to produce data that statistically resembles what the real data would be if it were available. No entry in this dataset corresponds to any real persons' data. For more details about how this data was produced, please see our technical report. 


The datasets in this repository are divided into the following files:

1. Virginia:
 - va_synthetic_population_and_outbreak_ver_1_9.zip
 - va_synthetic_population_and_outbreak_ver_1_9_instance_2.zip
 
2. United Kingdom:
 - gbr_synthetic_population_ver_0_9.zip
 - gbr_synthetic_outbreak_ver_0_9.split.zip gbr_synthetic_outbreak_ver_0_9.split.z01
 - gbr_synthetic_outbreak_ver_0_9_instance_2.zip 
 - gbr_synthetic_outbreak_ver_0_9_instance_2.split.zip gbr_synthetic_outbreak_ver_0_9_instance_2.split.z01 

Each of the datasets (Virginia/UK) contain the following files:
